# Go Engine
Utilizes Raylib for Go bindings available [here](https://github.com/gen2brain/raylib-go)

# NOTE
The latest version of this concept is written in C, located [here](https://github.com/JacobLondon/mg) under `src/rlu`. Some good examples are under `src/modules/atmos.c`. The bindings are pretty much 1:1 for what the Go bindings cover, so the code can be made to be the same in Go as in C.

# Dependency
```bash
go get -v -u github.com/gen2brain/raylib-go/raylib
```
